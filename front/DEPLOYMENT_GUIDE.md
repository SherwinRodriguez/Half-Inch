# ðŸš€ Factory Contract Deployment Guide

## Issue Identified
The Factory contract at address `0xD8714cAD07549c9cF80B2a2170E19720CF3c4B1c` **does not exist** on the Rootstock testnet. This is why pool discovery is failing.

## Solution: Deploy the Factory Contract

### Step 1: Navigate to Blockchain Directory
```bash
cd d:\Hues-full\block
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Check Hardhat Configuration
Make sure your `hardhat.config.js` has the Rootstock testnet configuration:

```javascript
networks: {
  rskTestnet: {
    url: 'https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co',
    chainId: 31,
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] // Make sure this is set
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
Create or update `.env` file in the `/block` directory:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
RPC_URL=https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co
```

### Step 5: Deploy Contracts
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rskTestnet
```

### Step 6: Update Frontend Environment
After deployment, update `d:\Hues-full\front\.env` with the deployed addresses:

```env
FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x_new_factory_address_here
ROUTER_ADDRESS=0x_new_router_address_here
WTRBTC_ADDRESS=0x_new_wtrbtc_address_here
# ... other contract addresses
```

### Step 7: Test the Deployment
Visit these endpoints to verify:
- `http://localhost:3000/api/quick-test`
- `http://localhost:3000/api/debug/factory-pairs`

## Alternative: Use Existing Deployed Contracts

If contracts are already deployed elsewhere, you just need to update the addresses in your `.env` file.

## Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check your private key has tRBTC for gas
2. Verify network configuration
3. Try a different RPC endpoint

### If RPC issues persist:
Try these alternative RPC endpoints:
- `https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co`
- `https://rootstock-testnet.drpc.org`
- `https://mycrypto.testnet.rsk.co`

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. âœ… Factory contract deployed
2. âœ… Pool creation will work
3. âœ… Pool discovery will work
4. âœ… Database storage will work
5. âœ… Pools page will show data

The entire DEX system will be functional once the contracts are properly deployed!
